## Introduction
Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on cell features obtained from biopsy samples. Through comprehensive data analysis and model development, we aim to offer insights into the potential use of machine learning in medical diagnostics for early and accurate detection of breast cancer.
## Models and Analysis

Various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been implemented to predict and analyze breast cancer diagnosis.
